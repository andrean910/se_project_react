## Intro

This project is a React application that displays clothing items based on the weather and allows users to view item details in a modal. It demonstrates component composition, state management with hooks, and responsive design principles. The app provides a clean, user‑friendly interface where clicking on an item card opens a modal with more details.

## Technologies and Techniques Used

- React for component‑based architecture and state management
- JavaScript ES6+ for logic and interactivity
- CSS for styling, layout, and responsive design
- Flexbox/Grid for adaptive layout across devices
- Conditional rendering for modal open/close states
- Accessible Design Principles to ensure inclusive user experience
- Modular Components: `App`, `Main`, `Header`,`WeatherCard`, `ItemCard`, `Footer`, `ItemCardModal`, `ModalWithForm`, etc.

## Figma

## Future Enhancements

To enhance this project, I would:

- Implement full modal close functionality (overlay click, ESC key, close button).
- Connect to a weather API for dynamic clothing suggestions.
- Add a form to allow users to add new clothing items dynamically.
- Persist clothing items with a backend or local storage.
- Improve accessibility with keyboard navigation and ARIA roles.
